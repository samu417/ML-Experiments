# 📊 Simple Linear Regression

A beginner-friendly **Machine Learning project** that uses **Simple Linear Regression** to predict placement-related outcomes from a given input.

## 📌 Project Overview

Simple Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between **one independent variable** and **one dependent variable**.

In this project, a regression model is trained using placement data and saved as a `.pkl` file. A simple web application is created using **Flask** to make predictions using the trained model.

## 🎯 Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

* Understand the concept of Simple Linear Regression
* Load and work with a dataset using Python
* Train a Linear Regression model
* Save the trained model using Pickle
* Create a simple Flask web application
* Make predictions through a web interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Flask**
* **Pickle**
* **HTML/CSS**

## 📈 Simple Linear Regression

The basic equation of Simple Linear Regression is:

```text
y = mx + c
```

Where:

* `y` = predicted output
* `x` = input feature
* `m` = slope/coefficient
* `c` = intercept

The model learns the relationship between the input and output from the training data.
